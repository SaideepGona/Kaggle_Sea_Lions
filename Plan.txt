          ------------------ Plan for Sea Lions Kaggle Competition --------------------

(N) 1.) Count the number of dots and record their locations for the reference images.
    - Use thresholding to isolate only the dots
    - Algorithm to identify and count the dots
    - Should be highly accurate

(O) 2.) Create the training set:
    - Chop up the images into reasonable sub-segments *****
    - These will overlap with one another at set intervals *****
    - Based on the coordinates of dots, assign a "correct answer" to each of the subimages *****
    - Training set is therefore a large number of images and their "correct answer"(number of respective sea lions)
    - Needs to be done in steps due to overwhelming size
    
(O) 3.) Train a neural net classifier 
    - Use the training set generated previously
    - Crossvalidate using the 20-80 rule
    - Optimization of this step is last priority, better to train using a predefined algo to a suitable accuracy 
    level and then stick with that

(N) 4.) Given the test data, perform the same chopping operation as in step 2 for each image
    - For each image, run the chopped sections through the trained classifier to return sea lion counts
    for the subimages
    - Use these counts to create frequency maps for each sea lion type
    - Local maxima on these maps should indicate presence of a sea lion, count them and output result
